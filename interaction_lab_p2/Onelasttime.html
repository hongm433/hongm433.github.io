      <p>I was a liar, I gave into the fire<br>
        I know I should've fought it, At least I'm bein' honest<br>
        Feel like a failure, 'Cause I know that I failed you<br>
        I should've done you better, 'Cause you don't want a liar<br><br>
        And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything<br>
        But boy, I couldn't give it to you<br>
        And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything<br>
        But I got nothin' here without you</p>
        
        <img src="images/5.jpg">
        <p>So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home<br>
        One more time, I promise after that, I'll let you go<br>
        Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart<br>
        All I really care is you wake up in my arms<br>
        One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home</p>

        <p>I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it<br>
        But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it<br>
        Can't you forgive me?, At least just temporarily<br>
        I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful<br><br>
        And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything<br>
        But boy, I couldn't give it to you<br>
        And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything<br>
        But I got nothin' here without you, baby</p>
