      <h2>One Last Time</h2>
      <p>I was a liar<br>
        I gave into the fire<br>
        I know I should've fought it<br>
        At least I'm bein' honest<br>
        Feel like a failure<br>
        'Cause I know that I failed you<br>
        I should've done you better<br>
        'Cause you don't want a liar</p>
        
        <p>And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything<br>
        But boy, I couldn't give it to you<br>
        And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything<br>
        But I got nothin' here without you</p>
        
        <p>So one last time<br>
        I need to be the one who takes you home<br>
        One more time<br>
        I promise after that, I'll let you go<br>
        Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart<br>
        All I really care is you wake up in my arms<br>
        One last time<br>
        I need to be the one who takes you home</p>
        
        <p>I don't deserve it<br>
        I know I don't deserve it<br>
        But stay with me a minute<br>
        I swear I'll make it worth it<br>
        Can't you forgive me?<br>
        At least just temporarily<br>
        I know that this is my fault<br>
        I should have been more careful</p>
        
        <p>And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything<br>
        But boy, I couldn't give it to you<br>
        And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything<br>
        But I got nothin' here without you, baby</p>
  
        <p>So one last time<br>
        I need to be the one who takes you home<br>
        One more time<br>
        I promise after that, I'll let you go<br>
        Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart<br>
        All I really care is you wake up in my arms<br>

        I need to be the one who takes you home</p>
  
        <p>I know I should've fought it<br>
        At least I'm bein' honest, yeah<br>
        Now stay with me a minute<br>
        I swear I'll make it worth it, yeah<br>
        'Cause I don't wanna be without you</p>
        
        <p>So one last time<br>
        I need to be the one who takes you home (babe)<br>
        One more time<br>
