    <p>This is one small step for woman<br>
      One giant leap for woman-kind<br><br>   
      I'd rather be alone tonight<br>
      You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight<br>
      Really don't wanna be in your arms tonight<br>
      I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight<br>
      Think I'm better off here all alone tonight<br>
      Ain't no checkin' on when I get home tonight<br>
      Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight<br>
      Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight</p>

      <img src="images/nasa1.jpg">
      <p>Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby<br>
      I can't really miss you if I'm with you<br>
      And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you<br>
      Baby, you know time apart is beneficial<br>
      It's like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A</p>

      <img src="images/nasa2.png">
      <p>Give you the whole world, I'ma need space<br>
      I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need<br>
      You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space<br>
      I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)<br>
      Give you the whole world, I'ma need space<br>
      I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need<br>
      You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space<br>
      I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)</p>

      <p>Bottom line<br>
      Usually I would love it if you stay the night<br>
      I just think I'm on another page tonight<br>
      It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time<br>
      Usually I would orbit around you<br>
      But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me<br>
      You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm</p>

      <p>You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover<br>
      Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under<br>
      You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover<br>
      (You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)<br>
