  <p>[How are you? / How are you]</p>
  <p>It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing.<br>
    Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark.<br>
    Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. </p>
  <p>A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing.<br>
    Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it.</p>
