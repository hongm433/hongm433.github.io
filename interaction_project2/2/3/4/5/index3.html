  <p>When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on,<br>
    I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing<br>
    I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on<br>
    and if writing should go on what had colons and commas to do with it,<br>
    what had periods to do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it<br>
    to do with writing going on which was at that time<br>
    the most profound need I had in connection with writing.</p>
