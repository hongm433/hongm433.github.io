    <p>When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot,<br>
      at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool<br>
      so anybody feels who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written.</p>
      
    <p class="p01">And what does a comma do, <b class="highlight">a comma does nothing</b><br>
        but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma.</p>
    
    <p class="p01">A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you,<br>
        make you know yourself knowing it and the comma,<br>
        well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath<br>
        but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath.<br>
        It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on, <br>
        but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath<br>
        and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath.</p>

    <p class="p01">Anyway that is the way I felt about it<br>
          and I felt that about it very very strongly.<br>
          And so I almost never used a comma.<br>
          The longer, the more complicated the sentence<br>
          the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another,<br>
          the more the very more I had of them<br>
          the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by themselves<br>
          and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.</p>

    <p class="p01">So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry<br>
      it is a little different but more so and later I will go into that.<br>
      But that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose.</p>
