      I can see that one might feel about them as periods<br>
      but I myself never have, I began unfortunately to feel them<br>
      as a comma and commas are servile they have no life of their own<br>
      they are <b>dependent</b> upon use and convenience<br>
      and they are put there just for <b>practical purposes</b>.</p>

      <p>Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely this character<br>
        the character that a comma has and not the character that a period has<br>
        and therefore and definitely I have never used them.</p>
        
      <p>But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly<br>
        they might have in them something of the character of the period<br>
        and so it might have been an adventure to use them.</p>
