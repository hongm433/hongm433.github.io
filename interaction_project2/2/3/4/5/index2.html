  <p class="desktop">When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on,<br>
    I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing<br>

    what had periods to do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it<br>
    to do with writing going on which was at that time<br>
    the most profound need I had in connection with writing.</p>
